Welcome to the ACA-Py documentation site! On this site you
will find documentation for all of the recent releases of ACA-Py -- starting from
LTS release 0.11.0.

> [!NOTE]
> ACA-Py has recently moved to the [OpenWallet
> Foundation](https://openwallet.foundation/). ACA-Py used to be called "Aries
> Cloud Agent Python", but in the move to OWF, we dropped the "Aries" part, and
> made the acronym the name. So ACA-Py it is!

All of the documentation here is extracted from the [ACA-Py repository].
If you want to contribute to the documentation, please start there.

## Code Internals Documentation

In addition to this documentation site, the ACA-Py community also maintains an
ACA-Py internals documentation site. The internals documentation consists of the
`docstrings` extracted from the ACA-Py Python code and covers all of the
(non-test) modules in the codebase. Check it out on the [ACA-Py ReadTheDocs site](https://aries-cloud-agent-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
As with this site, the ReadTheDocs documentation is version specific.
