# Establishing a connection between ACA-Py Agents

Use an ACA-Py issuer/verifier to establish a connection with a compatible mobile
wallet. Run the [Traction AnonCreds Workshop]. Get your own (temporary -- it
will be gone in a few weeks!) ACA-Py-based issuer/verifier
agent. Connect to the wallet on your mobile phone, issue a credential and then
present it back. Lots to learn, without ever leaving your browser!
